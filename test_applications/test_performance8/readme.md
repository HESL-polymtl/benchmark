# Test_Performance8

This application assess the Semaphore signaling with priority times. Two pre-compiler macros define the number iterations times and number of processes: NB_ITER and NB_TASK. 
If nothing is passed to the compiler, standard values are used: 1000 iterations and 1 process.

### Partition mapping to the A653 API tested in the present test application:

The following is the mapping of the (1) partition included in this application:

| Partition # | Tested feature    | Number of test |
| ----------- | ----------------  | -------------- |
|    P1       | Semaphore  		  |  	 1		   |
