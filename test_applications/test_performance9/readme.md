# Test_Performance9

This application assess the Semaphore signaling and wait times. One pre-compiler macros defines the number iterations times: NB_ITER. 
If nothing is passed to the compiler, standard values are used: 1000 iterations.

The following is the mapping of the (1) partition included in this application:

| Partition # | Tested feature    | Number of test |
| ----------- | ----------------  | -------------- |
|    P1       | Semaphore  		  |  	 1		   |
