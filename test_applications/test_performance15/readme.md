# Test_Performance15

This application relies on DIJKSTRA application and evaluates its execution time. Two pre-compiler macros - EDGES and DIJKSTRA_RUNS_PER_MEASURE - define the number of edges  and the total number of interactions, respectively. If nothing is passed to the compiler, 28 and 50 are used.
