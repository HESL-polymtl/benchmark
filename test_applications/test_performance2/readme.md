# Test_Performance2

This application assess the mutex request and release times. One pre-compiler macros defines the number iterations times: NB_INTER. 
If nothing is passed to the compiler, standard values are used: 300 iterations.

The following is the mapping of the (1) partition included in this application:

| Partition # | Tested feature    | Number of test |
| ----------- | ----------------  | -------------- |
