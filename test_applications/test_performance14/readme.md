# Test_Performance14

This application relies on ADPCM application and evaluates its execution time. Three pre-compiler macros - SIZE, IN_END and ADPCM_RUNS_PER_MEASURE - define the test vector size, the total number of executions and the total number of intercations, respectively. If nothing is passed to the compiler, 100, 100 and 20 are used. 

### Partition mapping to the A653 API tested in the present test application:

The following is the mapping of the (2) partition included in this application:

| Partition # | Tested feature    | Number of test |
| ----------- | ----------------  | -------------- |
|    P1       | ADPCM 			  |  	 1		   |
